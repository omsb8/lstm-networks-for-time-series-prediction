How to run this file:

There are three versiosn of our project: one in the .py file type, one in the .ipynb file type, and one .txt file.
It is best for you to run the .ipynb file in either Juypter Notebook or Google Colab, as this is the basis where we made our ML model.
To test parameters, you can go to the section under the comment "# Hyperparameters" and can modify any of the hyper parameters to test our model.
But please rerun everything in the code after you modify the hyperparameters, as it could produce different results if you run only a partial section of the code.
I would like to thank Ousama Batais for creating the ML model and the many defined functions. He is the expert of this ML model and if you have any question,
please refer to his contact information on the report.
